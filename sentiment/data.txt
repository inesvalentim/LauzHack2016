With his self-immolating campaign to make America great again, Donald Trump has put a lot of effort into make immigration one of, if not the biggest issue in the 2016 presidential race. Nearly every time the likely Republican candidate opens his mouth, hes promising Americans he'll build a Trump Wall along the southern border (and make Mexico pay for it), ban Muslims and birthright citizenship, and arm a militarized deportation force—among other things. At this point, Trump basically has a monopoly on the issue, hogging the spotlight while reporters chase their tails, explaining once again that no, Trump isnt going to build a Wall, and no, Mexico definitely isn't going to pay for it. In the meantime, there is almost no discussion about what someone other than Trump—and specifically, Hillary Clinton—wants to do about immigration. With such a rich silt of xenophobia to sift through, it seems, most people aren't paying attention to the alternative."

            "text": "She has made some eye-opening comments. If you ever believed that Hillary Clinton’s immigration stance was driven by anything other than cynical opportunism, you may want to reconsider. Already, Clinton has adopted a Merkel-like position on immigration. During the Democratic primaries, eager to avoid the ghosts of some unsavory comments she made in 2014, Clinton espoused a doctrine of open borders. “I would not deport children,” she said in March. “I do not want to deport family members either.” In other words: If you come here with your family, you will be allowed to stay. And if you’re already here illegally, Clinton believes in creating a path to citizenship for you, with or without Congress’s consent. None of these views place her outside the Democratic mainstream, at least as it stands at the moment. But of late her immigration stance has become incoherent. She still wants immigration reform, but now it seems like a path to citizenship is all such reform entails, at least on the first go-round. In a recent interview with Ezra Klein of Vox, Clinton said she opposes a plan that would also deal with reforms to the process by which high-skilled immigrants are granted visas: Comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship would deal with a lot of these concerns, not just the 11 million people here: how we would regularize them, what kind of steps they’d have to go through. Because I believe they do have to meet certain standards if they’re going to be on a path to citizenship. But I don’t want to mix that with other kinds of changes in visas and other concerns that particularly high-value technical companies have. In fact, I think keeping the pressure on them helps us resolve the bigger problem, and then we can look to see what else, if anything, can and should be done [emphasis added]. Put another way, Hillary Clinton not only believes that visa reform for high-skilled workers shouldn’t be part of immigration reform, but also that visa reform might not be a good idea at all. Clinton has taken the exact inverse position of the subset of economists who argue that an influx of high-skilled immigration, facilitated by visa reform, is an unequivocal economic good, and that the economic effects of low-skilled immigration are less positive. For some reason, she views the issues of visa reform and a path to citizenship as mutually exclusive, rather than symbiotic. Accordingly, she would focus on a path to citizenship while consciously rejecting efforts to reform the visa system."
